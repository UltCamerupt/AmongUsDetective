Among Us mod to allow one character to be the detective.

This mod must be used with the [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) custom Among Us server.

## About
This mod allows one of the crew to become a detective. You are the detective is you have the police skin and hat on.
With this mod the detective gains evidence to figure out who the impostor is.
To gain the evidence the detective must be the one to report the body and in chat they will get a clue as to who the impostor is. Only the detective can see this evidence (The notification may not show so you will need to be proactive and check the chat window).

Some of the evidence that you can recieve is:  
  - Color  
  - Skin  
  - Hat  
  - Pet

If anyone else reports the body, you do not get any evidence.

Sometimes you may gain the same evidence for two different bodies.
Also to make it not overpowered most of the evidence can overlap with multiple people so you may need multiple pieces of evidence to figure out the impostor.
If there are multiple impostors you will only gain the evidence for the impostor who did the deed. So on the second body you may get evidence for the second/third/etc impostor.

## Instalation
